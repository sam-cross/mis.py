# Mis.py
Mis.py the music library organiser.

**Mis.py isn't quite ready for use yet - there's a few more bits that need sorting out**

Mis.py is a command-line music library organising tool. The way it works is simple - you feed it a folder, and it will (by your choice) rename all music files and directories to the default schema, or one you specify (see command-line arguments below).

I created this tool to help me organise my extensive library, as I have many, many albums stored. However, some of them had odd folder & file naming structures - some were "Artist - Album", others "Artist - Album (Year)", and some even "Artist/Album". I wanted to unify my library with a simple structure - "Artist - Year - Album/Track - Title.format" - so I created **Mis.py**.

This project is almost complete. At the moment, it doesn't deal with nested directories well. There are still tests to be performed before a production version is released, so please *test on a directory you don't mind destroying* and **use at your own risk**.

## Command-Line Arguments

These are coming soon - run **Mis.py** with the `-h` option to see them for now.
